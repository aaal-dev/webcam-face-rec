# webcam-face-rec
Learning of C++, OpenGL, OpenCV, dlib and other stuff for face recognition. I want to do some stuff with Live2D on linux, but I am stuck with some issues.

Program on heavy reconstraction. Nothing to see here for now! 

I have complete face detection and face landmarks from webcam. It's not so difficult that I thought at first because of OpenCV. But other things is much difficult.

#### Use:  
glad - (OpenGL Loader) - https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad  
GLFW - (OpenGL window and input) - https://github.com/glfw/glfw  
NanoVG - (Vector Graphics rendering library for OpenGL) - https://github.com/memononen/nanovg  
OpenCV - (Open Source Computer Vision Library) - https://github.com/opencv/opencv  

#### Use but maybe replace later:
inih - (a simple .INI file parser) - https://github.com/jtilly/inih  
GLM - (OpenGL Mathematics) - https://github.com/g-truc/glm  
dlib - (Machine learning and data analysis) - https://github.com/davisking/dlib  
AssImp - (Open-Asset-Importer-Library) - https://github.com/assimp/assimp  

#### Replace:  
NanoGUI - (Minimalistic GUI library for OpenGL) - https://github.com/wjakob/nanogui 

NanoGUI is good enough. But when I wanted to do more that it has and I started to change some stuff it takes me pain. And I realised that for me is match better to use parent labrary NanoVG.
