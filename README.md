Эксперимент с OpenCV на OpenGL.


# webcam-face-rec
Learning of OpenCV, dlib, OpenGL and stuff for face recognition.

Nothig to see here for now! 

I want to do some stuff with Live2D on linux, but I am stuck with some issues.
I have complete face detection from webcam. It's not so difficult that I thought at first.
Now I am read some articles and stuff about eye and pupil recognition, and eye gaze detection.
